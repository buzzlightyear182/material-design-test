# my-travels
A mini data visualization project, plotted my travels across 8 years, using material design colors.

You can click on the year and dates, and it will show the place and date when I was there.

> I initially began this without much thought, I just wanted to visualize what days have I travelled since 2008. Now I can see more possible visualizations this project can do for further development.

####TODO:####

~~1. Reformat JSON data file~~

~~2. Refactor Javascript~~

3. Filter by month and location

4. Rails API autogenerate JSON

5. Refactor again to use AngularJS


Thanks also for bootstrap-material-design!
