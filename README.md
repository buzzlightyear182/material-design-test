# my-travels
Plotted my travels across 8 years, using material design colors.

You can click on the year and dates, and it will show the place and date when I was there.

I initially began this without much thought, I just wanted to visualize what days have I travelled since 2008. Now I can see more possible visualizations this project can do for further development.

TODO:

(1) Reformat JSON data file

(2) Refactor Javascript

(3) Filter by month and location

(4) Rails API autogenerate JSON


Thanks also for bootstrap-material-design!
